# Database and Tool Comparison in Cell-Cell Communication Analysis

It is well recognized that communication tools and pipelines are constrained by the data available in their respective ligand-receptor databases. If there these databases contain bias towards a certain ligand-receptor spectrum, so too are results. Therefore, it's crucial to compare the default databases with unified custom databases, considering both ligand-receptor interactions confirmed in the literature and those predicted by computational tools. This section focuses on the comparative analysis of different databases.

## Database Structure and Customization
Comparing databases can be challenging due to the diverse structures used by different tools. For instance, `CellPhoneDB` utilizes `SQLAlchemy` with multiple tables, `community` uses a single table, and `NicheNet` employs three different networks to link ligands to their target genes. The `community` tool is designed to simplify the creation of custom databases through user-friendly interfaces, allowing modifications of the default database as a csv/tsv file.

##### Dataset Used for Comparison
The comparison of databases is facilitated through the [`/compare_databases`](./method_comparison/compare_algorithms) section. This subsection details the datasets used and the process for comparing the default databases of `CellPhoneDB`, `NicheNet`, and `community`. It also provides instructions for generating a unified custom database for each tool, aiming to standardize the comparison process.

##### Unified Structure for Comparing Results
To ensure a fair comparison between different communication tools, we have developed a standardized approach for result analysis. The pipeline under the [/results_comparison/](./method_comparison/compare_results) directory is used for running each tool with the same input dataset and database. The databases are generated using the [/build_customDB](./method_comparison/compare_algorithms) section for each tool. The outputs are then transformed into a unified format, enabling a thorough comparison of the results. This approach ensures that differences in the output are attributable to the inherent capabilities of each tool, rather than to variations in output format.
