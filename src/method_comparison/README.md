It is well recognized that communication tools and pipelines are limited by the data available in their respective databases. Consequently, it is important to acknowledge that these tools merely reflect the data they contain, and if the databases are biased, so too are the results. Therefore, comparing default databases and creating unified custom databases is crucial to ensuring fair and accurate comparisons between different tools.

However, comparing databases can be challenging due to the diverse structures used by different tools. For instance, while `CellPhoneDB` utilizes `SQLAlchemy` with multiple tables, `community` uses a single table. To simplify the process, `community` tool authors have designed the tool in a user-friendly manner, enabling the creation of custom databases through spreadsheets or by exporting and modifying the default database as a csv/tsv file.

Notwithstanding, the process of building a custom database requires an in-depth understanding of the underlying biology and the specific experimental context. As such, it is essential to ensure that the database is well-curated and validated before using it for analysis.


It is worth noting that the comparison of databases is facilitated through the [`/compare_defaultDB`](./compare_defaultDB) section of this directory, where default databases of `CellPhoneDB`, `NicheNet` and `community` can be compared. In contrast, the [/build_customDB section](./customDB_building) provides detailed instructions on how to generate a unified custom database for each tool. This approach aims to simplify the process of creating custom databases and enables users to easily modify the database to suit their specific experimental requirements. 

Furthermore, to ensure a fair comparison between different communication tools and pipelines, we need to convert the results into a unified structure, given that each tool produces results in different formats. To achieve this, we use the pipeline under [/results_comparison/](./results_comparison) directory, where we run each tool with the same input dataset and database, which was generated using the "/build_customDB" section for each tool. Once the results are produced, we transform the output of each tool into a unified format, enabling us to perform a thorough comparison of the results. This approach ensures that any observed differences in the output are due to the inherent capabilities of each tool, rather than differences in the output format. By taking a systematic approach to the comparison of results, we can gain valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each communication tool and pipeline, ultimately improving our understanding of intercellular communication in biological systems.
