# CellPhoneDB

To make a fair comparison between different tools, it is necessary to convert all the databases into a uniform structure, as each tool utilizes a unique database with a distinct structure.

By standardizing the databases, we can create a uniform database for all the tools, allowing us to compare their algorithms objectively.

Therefore, the `Breakdown_CPDB.ipynb` in the `ReStructure_CPDB` directory outlines the process for converting the CellPhoneDB database into a uniform structure, while `Create_Custom_CPDB.ipynb` is used to create a custom database that is standardized for all tools, enabling fair and objective comparisons between algorithms.
