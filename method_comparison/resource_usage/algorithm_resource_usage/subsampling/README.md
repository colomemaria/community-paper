# Resource Usage: Algorithms

To begin, we use the `split.py` script to subsample the data. This script takes the directory of the count matrix and splits it into smaller subsets under the given output directory.

Below is the detailed information on splitting:



| Tool            | Subsampling Configurations                                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lasry           | 3 case, 3 control <br> 7 case, 6 control                    |
| Simillie        | 3 case, 3 control <br> 7 case, 6 control <br> 10 case, 12 control |
| vanGalen_Oetjen | 3 case, 3 control <br> 7 case, 6 control <br> 9 case, 10 control <br> 24 case, 9 control |
